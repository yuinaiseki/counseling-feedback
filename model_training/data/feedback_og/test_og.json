I have accepted that we will probably not be on good terms in the future.\nHelper: You should strive to be on good terms, no matter how long it takes. It's just a matter of how long\nSeeker: I should, I fear that it will take too long, but it is worth it.\nHelper: That's a valid fear and it's okay. It can be hard not knowing how long it will take.

The company I work for has had layoffs and is talking about it again in a few months. This makes me really nervous\nHelper: It seems like that fear of losing your job has been taking a toll on you.\nSeeker: It has indeed. I chose an industry that was fairly stable and a company that hadn't done layoffs in a long time but COVID changed all of that.\nHelper: Yeah, COVID is an unprecedented time where anything can happen. It must be frustrating knowing the safe path was taken but even then jobs might be taken away for something out of your control.\nSeeker: Yes! Exactly and I cannot stand that. I love my routine and predicability.\nHelper: I can relate to that. It's always nice when everything falls into place. The prospect of a sudden change stresses me out and I imagine you've been feeling the same way as well. What's your fear if you lose your job?\nSeeker: Very much so. If I lose my job I can't pay my bills and keep a roof over my head. In a good economy it took me over 300 applications, 50 interviews, and over 6 months to find a job.\nHelper: I think even if you lose your job, you would still be able to obtain resources through unemployment or even a stay at home temporary job from an employment agency while you look for another one or for your company to return to normal.\nSeeker: I would hope so\nHelper: I can definitely relate. I've submitted around that many applications if not more before I found my current job. But working as a temp at other companies has helped me provide for myself in the meantime. :). You have every right to feel the way you do though. It's a scary time but know that things will be okay.\nSeeker: Right. It's just not something I want to go through again. I just got this job 18 months ago. That job hunting dread and feeling hasn't gone away.\nHelper: I understand. It definitely is an agonizing process but you've gone through it before and have 18 months of experience under your belt from your current job which looks good on any resume.

Did I do something to her, did someone say something to her etc? Maybe I should just wait to talk to her when she needs me for something?\nHelper: There are several ways you could approach this situation.

It's 50% of my grade.\nHelper: I can understand taking a test can be stressful. Have you been studying for it?\nSeeker: It's not something to study for but something I've been working on for months.\nHelper: What subject matter is it for? What have you done to prepare for it? What level of schooling are you in now?\nSeeker: It's community health. It's a paper not a test. And it's a group project. We have been implementing a class in a homeless shelter for months and we are measuring the success on that implementation for the adult male population. And we have been finding research articles to support our project.\nHelper: Papers can be very stressful, especially when it is a group project. When I went to graduate school I had to complete 4 full papers on different subjects in 72 hours. Do you feel like you've made progress in finding the necessary information?\nSeeker: Yes I understand it's stressful. And yes we've made progress.\nHelper: I'm sure that if everyone puts in the effort, you will all be successful with your paper. Is there anything I can do to help?\nSeeker: I can't stand working in groups because there is always someone who doesn't pull their own weight and it usually falls on me to make up for it. I just get so stressed out every time I think about it.\nHelper: I can tell you're stressed about it and group projects are very hard. Perhaps you can all put a plan together an allocate tasks to make sure that everyone puts in their share of the work? Is that something you've considered?\nSeeker: Yes. I've done that. But still have people who don't seem to stick to the plan.\nHelper: I've been in this situation. Instead of stressing yourself about it, have you tried speaking to your professor or other group mates about making sure that everyone pulls their weight? Some professors take that into consideration.\nSeeker: Yes I have talked to my other group members and most of them are on board. I could go to the professor. That's an idea.\nHelper: I found in my experience that professors are very receptive to hear about how others are performing in the group and will weigh that information when grading.\nSeeker: Yeah you could be right about that.\nHelper: I hope that you find that suggestion helpful. When is your paper due?\nSeeker: In a few days.\nHelper: Well, the good news is once you submit it, you'll be able to enjoy a holiday break and hopefully de-stress!

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGive feedback to the Helper's last response.\n\n### Input:\nHelper: I do know people who have gone through the exact same thing in the past. When another animal attacks one of your fur-babies, it's absolutely terrible. However, the fact that this woman was given the option to either get rid of her dog or move tells me that you are 100% correct in the way that you handled this situation. It's unfortunate for the woman, yes, but she should have had more control over her dog. It's bad enough when one animal is attacked, but when it's more than one, that's when you really know that it's a problem. Again, legally, she had to make a choice, and that's because she failed to properly secure her dog. I really don't feel as though you did anything wrong. If I were you, I would ask to speak with the neighbors who have an issue with you face-to-face. I know it may be difficult, but I think that would be the best way to go about it. Are you on good terms with the other person whose dog was attacked?\nSeeker: I totally agree with you! The woman is disabled and I think most of the neighbors feel sorry for her. I've seen her loose control of the dog before, but she never attacked another dog(s). I've even seem the dog pull her scooter over and the woman needed lots of help to get back into it. I think everyone feels sorry for her.\nHelper: That probably has a lot to do with it. I would feel sorry for her too, as it is very sad in general. However, it doesn't excuse the fact that her animal attacked two other dogs.\nSeeker: I've talked to the neighbors face-to-face and they just think that I overreacted. The woman started getting her dog and private training and so they feel that she was trying. My point was that my dog weighs 15 pounds and her dog weighs 45 pounds and, if it happens again, I may not have a dog anymore. I don't want to wait until a dog is killed or badly injured. I told them exactly what you just said, but they are being mean!. I guess I could try talking to them again. Maybe they've cooled off some.\nHelper: That is absolutely terrible. In that case, I would just tell them that you refuse to allow another dog to possible injure or kill your own dog, so you did what was necessary to protect your fur-baby. Had you not done anything, this could have happened again, and the outcome may have been much worse. At that point, if they still don't respond kindly, I'd tell them that you still feel as though you did what needed to be done, that you understand why they are upset, but that you will always do whatever it takes to protect your dog. Hopefully, they will stop being mean. Even if they just stop talking to you completely, it's better than them harassing you or something along those lines. If they do start escalating their nasty behavior, I'd let the manager of your complex know that you're being mistreated. I always try to keep things calm and quiet, but I refuse to be taken advantage of or treated poorly. Personally, as I stated previously, I wholeheartedly believe that you did the right thing. If they're unable to see that, I'd try to just avoid contact with them unless it's necessary. I know it stinks and I'd be sad too, but unfortunately, some people just don't know how to let things go and seem to find joy in making other people upset. I'm so sorrry that you're dealing with all of this.\nSeeker: Thank you so much! Those are really good suggestions. I'll do that and, hopefully, they will calm down. If not, I have other friends that live outside my neighborhood. And I can talk to the manager like you said. I appreciate your help today. And your validation that I did nothing wrong. I was beginning to second guess my actions.\nHelper: I'm so glad that I was able to offer helpful suggestions! Hang in there. You sound like a strong person! I would definitely spend some time with your true friends who live outside of your neighborhood. I can assure you that if someone else's animal attacked one of mine, I would have done the exact same thing that you did.\nSeeker: THANK YOU! Take care!\nHelper: You're very welcome! You do the same.

Would your friend respect your request if you made one do you think?\nSeeker: Yes that's true. I believe he might understand me and accept my request. Would be quite challenging if we will meet my ex wth other friends in same pub. I live in a small town.\nHelper: oh I see, yes that could be awkward for sure. i think it's important you go out with your friend, but can understand your reluctance to run into your ex. Could you go out for coffee or lunch instead?\nSeeker: Well that's would be quite strange as we usually meet only for drinks.\nHelper: Ah gotcha. So do you think you will accept or not? Or still need time to think about it?\nSeeker: I will give it a go and see what happens. I will text you tomorrow to let you know how it went\nHelper: i hope if you go that you have an enjoyable time, and that your friend respects your boundaries. And worse case scenario, if your ex is there, you could leave early...if it were me I'd warn my friend that I might have to. I'm glad you are going! Take care of yourself and have a good time.

How are you today?\nSeeker: I've been better. I've been really sad ever since my girlfriend and I broke up and I don't know what to do.\nHelper: The end of a relationship is a really difficult time. How long were you together?\nSeeker: Yeah every day has been pretty hard. We were together for about 3 years.\nHelper: Three years is a long time. What led to the breakup?\nSeeker: We found ourselves arguing more and more each day.\nHelper: I've been in relationships like that. It really takes it out of you. What are your days like now?\nSeeker: Every day has been feeling the same. I didn't like that we fought but now I feel empty. I don't know what to do.\nHelper: I can totally understand why you're feeling that way. How long have you been seperated?\nSeeker: It's been about a month now.\nHelper: So this is still really fresh. It's going to take some time to start to feel normal after three years. What have you been doing for self-care? What have you been doing for self-care?\nSeeker: I haven't really been doing much. My friends invite me out but I never feel like going.\nHelper: After a three year relationship, you're going to have a period of mourning. This happens whether the breakup was right or wrong. It's still a huge part of your life now separated, and that's an important life event.\nSeeker: Yeah that makes sense. It's just hard you know. What steps should I take to feel better?\nHelper: I think it would be good for you to go out with your friends. Sometimes when you're really down, you might not feel like it. Going out takes effort, but it's worth it.\nSeeker: Okay I'll try to make an effort to go out more.\nHelper: Isolating at home is not going to help you process things.

I didn't really miss her until I saw her with someone else. is this normal I don't know what to do about this?\nHelper: I'd say this is completely normal. I can tell by talking to you that you did have strong feelings for this person once and seeing her with someone else has made you remember the good times.\nSeeker: Well that's good to know.

Most children that age do things like that ;)\nSeeker: She doesn't seem to think that it's wrong to thrown her dirty socks in the living room instead of the laundry. I guess so.\nHelper: Well, it is a bit anti social but there are a lot of worse things she could be doing :) I was pretty slobby at that age too\nSeeker: I'm 53 so going through menopuase while she is going through puberty. True. I just wish she would take some pride in her things and herself.\nHelper: Ah that's a bad combination. I hear you on the menopause thing. Do you think maybe it is making you more touchy?

Do you believe there are any causes behind the actions of those hurting you?\nSeeker: My husband mainly. He just doesn't want me to enjoy life I guess.\nHelper: That must be really difficult to go through, I know when my partner treats me badly, I am hurt and upset with them.\nSeeker: Yeah, just become part of life I guess. Doesn't make it any better.\nHelper: Are there any steps you can think of taking to express your frustrations with your husband?\nSeeker: I have tried many times. It always ends up my fault in the end so I don't bother anymore and just take it.\nHelper: It is easy to lose patience when the blame is always directed towards you. I am sorry that is occurring, but applaud you for your efforts in trying to express your frustration.\nSeeker: Thank you. It gets trying at times. Tonight, I just sit in the dark alone because it isn't worth the hassle.\nHelper: I can tell from chatting with you that you are struggling and fed up with this situation because you are trying very hard in your marriage but get nothing but disrespect in return.\nSeeker: That is for sure. Most of the time it is just the way life is but there are days I get fed up and it irritates me. It has been this way for a while.\nHelper: From what I have seen, if a situation like this continues, not only will you be consumed with anger towards your husband which will all come out at once, but it may also lead to divorce based on research I have read about.\nSeeker: I won't divorce...even if I am miserable, that isn't an option.\nHelper: I understand. I would prefer to work out a situation rather than use divorce as an option as well, but I am concerned with how miserable you have become.\nSeeker: I have gotten used to it. It is the way I am supposed to live my life I guess.\nHelper: Some people respond to different strategies. You have tried communication through words to tell your husband your feelings, but have you shown him the consequences of his actions? Does he see how miserable you are? I suppose I wonder if you are interested in utilizing different strategies to find a solution to your issues with your husband and any others who may treat you badly.\nSeeker: He knows I am miserable. He knows I am upset. He is the living room watching tv and I am in the bedroom. It doesn't bother him that I am upset. It is getting late where I am and I should probably go to bed soon.\nHelper: Alright. I have enjoyed talking to you, and hope that things will work out for you. My last suggestion is possibly to try to talk your husband into couple's therapy and see how he responds. Even if he responds negatively, at least you have tried to dissolve the issue once again. In situations like this, remember even when you feel completely alone, that someone is looking out for you even if you do not realize it. Take a few calming deep breaths and engage in self-care, you deserve it.\nSeeker: Thank you, good night.\nHelper: You're welcome.

Its not like he invited you over to tease you. It is true that he didn't keep his promise, and that's his fault.\nSeeker: That's true. He didn't invite me over. I expected him to be at work that night. I was coming over to see our cats, which still all lived with him. I still had a key and it didn't occur to me that I could invade his privacy since I had been spending 3X a week with him, and he was fine with me using the key. The whole thing was a shock. I wouldn't have come in had I known what I'd find inside.\nHelper: That would definitely add to the distress of the situation to have a weird surprise like that. It doesn't really seem like your fault that you were there but it is unfortunate nonetheless. Have you tried talking to h im yet?\nSeeker: Yeah. It's a long story to explain here, but at first he told me it was a first date... then he said it was a second date... then finally he said it was a third date. I had to figure out on my own that he met her through a dating app, which makes me feel extra icky because now I kind of feel like a stalker. (Don't worry, I didn't do anything illegal or immoral to figure this out at all. He left an easy breadcrumb trail for me to follow.... but it still feels gross that I felt compelled to research the situation because I could \"feel\" he was lying.)\nHelper: That's ok, you have a vested interest in this person. It is natural to be interested in such things.\nSeeker: Yes. I'm not only invested in him. I have a SUPER close relationship with his two daughters. Some of the reason he wanted to see me after our \"break up\" is because he didn't want to tell his daughters that I might be out of their lives forever. He told me so much. And I love those girls so much. They're 13 and 16. They were 7 and 11 when I started seeing their dad.\nHelper: There are a lot of therapists out there that might be able to help you navigate this. It's OK to get some outside help.\nSeeker: That's a good suggestion. I think individual therapy might benefit me. I could ask him if he's open to couple's counseling--even if it's over, it could help with closure.\nHelper: That sounds like a great idea!

I don't know how to live by myself.\nHelper: Why do you think you find yourselves in this situation?\nSeeker: Because he was my life. I spent every waking second with him. He cleaned the things I couldn't. He did the things I couldn't do. I have to basically re-learn how to live by myself again. It's really scary, you know?\nHelper: I can understand your feelings right now, It's hard to ignore all those memories and moments.

I'm scared I'll never be able to find someone else or even think about dating anyone else. Probably living alone and being on my own. I don't really miss him honestly.

I know that's scary for you, but what's the meaning of life without being scared and have our feelings?\nSeeker: That's very true. I have to think about the future. I can do it on my own. I just have to think...this is the worst it'll ever be.\nHelper: But you should start to take control over your feelings at first, you are the boss and you give the orders!. Slowly but surely you find yourself in a better mood. You said you felt relieved, and that's an opportunity\nSeeker: I will try.

Do you need the money, or can you maybe take a short break from work until you catch up?\nSeeker: So I do actually need the money. I just moved out on my own and I have a lot of bills that I use to not have when I was living with my parents. I might be able to cut back a couple hours a week but then I might have to give up some fun things I like to do\nHelper: True. Once you're on the other side of this semester, you can put in more hours. Do you absolutely have to finish this semester, or can you put off a course until the next term?\nSeeker: I would like to finish this semester just because I have a job lined up for me right when I graduate where I can make a lot more money and not struggle as much financially\nHelper: Is the job contingent on graduation? Maybe you could take one course while you do the job. Work full-time and study part-time.\nSeeker: I do have to have the degree to start the job thats the only part that isnt great.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGive feedback to the Helper's last response.\n\n### Input:\nSeeker: I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot\nHelper: Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.\nSeeker: Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating.\nHelper: Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.\nSeeker: Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school.\nHelper: Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments.\nSeeker: Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break. I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe.\nHelper: Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing. HOw man classes do you have? many *\nSeeker: I have 6 classes\nHelper: That's a lot but it is totally doable. Here is a good example, If you plant seeds in a garden today, you have to weed it a bit tomorrow, the next day, the next day, you have to wait for rain, then weed some more, the harvest comes and YAY! You are happy. But if you lie on your bed, never planting, never weeding, you procrastinate, you get nothing. If you write your classes down and then write a reasonable time to study each one. Maybe 3 today, 3 tomorrow, then add rewards if you do that, maybe make a list of rewards, so you can pick and choose, then you check off when you do the subject. Like a chore chart.\nSeeker: Yes haha. That is a good comparison. You have been super helpful. I will for sure try to use your advice. Thank you!. Have a great day and thanks again\nHelper: You are very welcome! Have a wonderful day!\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Professionalism\", \"Structure\"]}",

Have you tried any of these techniques?\nSeeker: That sounds like it could help. Maybe I could even try yoga.\nHelper: Yes, that sounds like a great idea. I think yoga can be very beneficial in managing stress.\nSeeker: Do you have any other suggestions for those busy days when I am non-stop?\nHelper: I think it is important to remember to take care of yourself. That means eating right and exercising. I found from my own experience of going through a stressful situation that exercise was the best technique for managing stress.\nSeeker: Maybe I can get my friends to go for an early morning walk before I start the pressures of the day. That might work to help me stay calmer.\nHelper: I understand that there are days where it feels non stop and it can be hard to find the time. Excercising early in the morning is a great idea because it gets you off to a good start to the day. I like the idea of including friends too. That can be a great motivator.\nSeeker: Do you have any other suggestions on what could maybe make up for one or two \"B\" grades? It's hard to be perfect, but these programs are demanding.\nHelper: You're right, it is hard to be perfect because perfection is not attainable. The pressure to be perfect can be really overwhelming, and it's okay to have some 'B' grades. They do not define your worth or your ability. You could consider discussing with your professors on how you could improve.\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Validation\", \"Empathy\"]}",

I'm worried that he all of a sudden is so distant.\nHelper: If it were entirely up to you how would you like your relationship to proceed from here?\nSeeker: I would ideally like him to say he was sorry and never look at another woman but now I doubt his faithfulness and think the only reason I'm with him is because I'm so lonely.\nHelper: It sounds like you worry you will not be able to trust him in the future because of this no matter what his future actions are, do you think there is anything he could do or say that would change this?\nSeeker: I do worry a lot. If he would commit fully to me that would help perhaps. If he never cheated again but I don't know if he can do that reliably.\nHelper: What would you define as full commitment from him?\nSeeker: I think marriage, but then again if he cheats then what commitment is that really if it ends in divorce?\nHelper: That's true and divorce can be expensive. You mentioned before that you feel like you are with him mostly because you are lonely, is that how your relationship started?\nSeeker: That's a good point you make. I was lonely and wanting to fill that void. But, I do want a family. I'm just not sure he is that committed or even mature enough to handle this responsibility. Perhaps I'm naive.\nHelper: I don't think you are naive, you are clearly asking yourself the right questions about building a future with him\nSeeker: Thanks for the encouragment.\nHelper: Do you have friends and family around that could help distract you from the loneliness until you find someone you are comfortable starting a family with?\nSeeker: Maybe that would be a good plan as I am close with my family.

Is their anything in particular making you feel anxious?\nSeeker: Yes. I dropped out of graduate school. Now, I need to get a job, but I'm having difficulty finding jobs for my degrees. And it's just stressful and depressig\nHelper: Drastic changes in our life plans can feel very upsetting and looking for a job in these times is ridiculous.\nSeeker: Yes, it really is\nHelper: What made you feel the need to drop out of graduate school?\nSeeker: I wasn't finding the program challenging or interesting or a life course I was sure I wanted to go down anymore. The only jobs I really can do with biology are lab jobs, which are somewhat boring. There are some others, but not many\nHelper: I understand that and that was a really brave choice to make before you cornered yourself into a degree that wouldn't benefit your future paths.\nSeeker: Yea, I think that's true.

I mostly have been looking online at places like indeed.com. I'm not sure what you mean by \"job center,\" I guess, either\nHelper: Refusing to finish something that does not benefit your end goal isn't quitting its merely switching strategies to your personal end goal\nSeeker: Oh, yea.

All this education hasn't really left with me many hard skills, I feel\nHelper: I am from North Carolina and in every city there are job centers, you can look them up by that title, they have people there who can help you find work based on your personality and skills. as well helping with resumes, interveiws, computers, all kinds of things.\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to offer the seeker support and advice.

How are you?\nSeeker: Hi, I am in a town all alone and far from family. I have been really depressed.\nHelper: Why are you in a town all alone?\nSeeker: Yes, I moved away and I thought I would be happier on my own but now all I do is think about them and miss them. Nobody ever has time to talk on the phone so I am all alone.\nHelper: Do you have the option to move back? Because family is the most important thing at the end of the day\nSeeker: No, I was living with my mom and dad but when I moved out my brother got my room. He and I didnt get along so he would never want me to move back into the house with them either.\nHelper: At this point, you will have to ask your family to make time to talk with you and im sure they will understand if they hear where you are coming from\nSeeker: That is a good idea, I can reach out to my mom. Maybe I should write her an email or something?My brother was a bully and so he is a big reason that I moved. My parents encouraged us to fight and argue, it wasn't a very fun place to live. I've always been closer to my mom so she is much more understanding. She helps me pay my monthly bills too.\nHelper: Yeah reach out to your mum, and although you fight and argue, they are still your family at the end of the day. Thats nice of her :)\nSeeker: Yes, that is a good point. I have always heard the blood is thicker than water. I have also been upset lately because I had to leave all my pets when I moved out. I left my dog and my cat back at home.\nHelper: Have you visited them ever since?\nSeeker: No, I am too far away to stop by or go for the weekend. I would have to plan a whole trip and I cant really afford it yet. My brother knew that the pets were mine but he demanded that he keep them there and I didnt want to fight with him so I said fine.\nHelper: If they are your pets you should be able to keep them but you did the right thing as to not argue with your brother and your parents could help you look after them\nSeeker: Yeah, you are right. Once he let the gate open just so my dog would run away, he says he didn't do it but I know him and he is really mean and vengeful. He would also pull pranks on me that were just cruel. He once told me that my cat was ran over but he was just hiding her at a friends house for a week.\nHelper: Yeah, he doesn't seem very nice, but its good that you don't retaliate negatively\nSeeker: Yeah, I used to be really depressed living there. I haven't thought about why I moved but you are helping me remember that i'm better off now.

Can't complain very much about it.\nHelper: That's awesome, is there any aspect about your job that you don't like or enjoy as much?\nSeeker: To be honest, not really. I pretty much self-manage and do not have to deal with people, which is a good thing for me. Every now and then I'll have to work with a new person who isn't as competent and that can be frustrating.\nHelper: I can understand it, it sounds like you are in a position where you oversee others are in a teaching capacity. I too am in a similar position, and when people aren't as responsive to my ideas, it can definitely irritate me.\nSeeker: Yeah. It's more of a competency problem with me I think. I'm fine if people aren't responsive to my personal ideas, but as far as a work situation - or any situation where there are pre-agreed situations that must be dealt in certain ways - that is frustrating. I think I expect too much from people - but really my expectations aren't that high, I don't think - if I really think about it.\nHelper: That makes sense, but it might be helpful to think about the other person's situation. Perhaps he/she hasn't had the same amount of training? Perhaps, they just need a little more guidance than other people who are more able to complete the tasks.\nSeeker: That is true, and a good point. My main issue - it's not just related to work - I'm not a \"liker\" of people in general, but I am nice to everyone. I have a hard time relating to most people.\nHelper: What aspects do you especially have a hard time relating with?\nSeeker: Well, it seems someone has to have to have gone through some hard times as well, for me to relate to them. And to have learned from those hard times. So that cuts out a good bit of people who have had good lives - and then half the people who have gone through some stuff haven't learned from it and made themselves better. So it s. So I have to try to weed everyone out, but that's exhausting.\nHelper: That does sound exhausting, though some people might be reluctant to share their personal experiences, and it might be helpful to start smaller when getting to know someone and working up to more serious conversations.\nSeeker: Thats good advice. Often Im fine with the way thjngs are going, but every once in a while it bothers me.\nHelper: I think it's great that it doesn't happen often and that you are able to recognize the few situations where it does begin to bother you.\nSeeker: Yeah I try to stay cognizant of these things. Ive had some psych training so it helps out.\nHelper: That's even better! You are able to use your own skills to recognize the problems and take the appropriate steps forward.

Is there something in particular at school that is stressing you out? Exams? Relationships?\nSeeker: Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough.\nHelper: I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now?\nSeeker: I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot\nHelper: Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.\nSeeker: Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating.\nHelper: Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.\nSeeker: Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school.\nHelper: Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal.

Or is your anxiousness also caused by other life factors as well?\nSeeker: School is the start of the problem. I know that if I quit I can still be successful elsewhere but I also feel if I quit I will let my wife and kids down who were willing to leave family and friends to follow me to the school I wanted to go to.\nHelper: I understand what you are going through. It is as if you are being pulled in two directions, but are not sure which is the best option at the given moment.

Do you think there was a specific instance that is causing doubts within yourself or is it in your nature to self-doubt?\nSeeker: It is in my nature to self doubt. Additionally, I have had a few bumps in the road during my program and struggle to pick myself up after those bumps. For example, I am on academic probation and have a certain expectation over the next few months that I have to hit to stay in the program due to struggles in previous classes. I am reaching the bar just fine, according to those that I work with, and often feel I am doing quite well but occasionally I start to panic and think that I am not doing as well as I think that I am and start to spiral\nHelper: This has also been a past struggle of mine, and I think it partially stems from the bar we set so high for ourselves. We obviously cannot reach the top right away, but have to work our way up. Often times, when facing an obstacle, such as a bad grade, we might retreat further down the path due to fear that it will keep happening. I know that I personally had a tendency to think of my family and friends who I feel are dependent on me or comparing myself with others when the only person we should think of in these instances is ourself. When making progress, tiny steps upward matter more than you think. But when we take a step backward, we cannot fall back down to the starting point by letting our doubts pile upon one another.\nSeeker: That is a really good point and helpful.

How long were you together?\nSeeker: Yeah every day has been pretty hard. We were together for about 3 years.\nHelper: Three years is a long time. What led to the breakup?\nSeeker: We found ourselves arguing more and more each day.\nHelper: I've been in relationships like that. It really takes it out of you. What are your days like now?\nSeeker: Every day has been feeling the same. I didn't like that we fought but now I feel empty. I don't know what to do.\nHelper: I can totally understand why you're feeling that way. How long have you been seperated?\nSeeker: It's been about a month now.\nHelper: So this is still really fresh. It's going to take some time to start to feel normal after three years. What have you been doing for self-care? What have you been doing for self-care?\nSeeker: I haven't really been doing much. My friends invite me out but I never feel like going.\nHelper: After a three year relationship, you're going to have a period of mourning. This happens whether the breakup was right or wrong. It's still a huge part of your life now separated, and that's an important life event.\nSeeker: Yeah that makes sense. It's just hard you know. What steps should I take to feel better?\nHelper: I think it would be good for you to go out with your friends. Sometimes when you're really down, you might not feel like it. Going out takes effort, but it's worth it.\nSeeker: Okay I'll try to make an effort to go out more.\nHelper: How have you been spending your time at home?

My scholarship requires me to maintain a certain GPA and I can't afford to lose it (4)\nHelper: It's good to hear that you're not giving up. Sometimes in these situations, you just have to do your best and then at least you know you did what you could. I like to tell myself in these situations that if there are no other avenues to explore, you just have to 'go with the flow' and don't beat yourself up thinking about it over and over - if there's nothing you can do, just do your best to ride it out\nSeeker: I know, there is just so much riding on these finals. I have great grades so I'm praying that I pass without any issues and that I don't bomb even one of them (5). Are you still there?\nHelper: If you tried hard previously then you may come out the other end having done very well!

I actually had to block them on all social media. They are extremely religous. Which there is nothing wrong with that. But he didn't have the best relationship with any of them. They couldn't accept him for who he was. His biological father didn't have anything to do with him. His mom was remarried and had two more kids and they didn't treat my boyfriend very good growing up. He ended up living with his grandparents. He finally had acceptance in my family. He actually talked to my mom more than I did lol.\nHelper: Sounds like a very complicated set up. It is sad when family members become partially estranged from one another.\nSeeker: His family has been pretty horrible to me and my girls.

I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant.

I already have to work about 55 hours/week. I do mturk to pay my phone bill (sort of a bet with my wife lol). I'm wanting to maybe move into freelance work but the market is flooded because of covid. So many working from home and freelancing these days.\nHelper: You are right. I feel your anxiety in this. Competition is high in all industries right now it seems. Maybe sign up with those employment sites online. Indeed, ZipRecuiter, etc...it can't hurt to see what other options are out there.\nSeeker: Not sure what is going to happen to my industry. The demand for new products is astounding. For example we have been working on cargo holds for aircraft that replaces seats and maintains social distancing protocols. I actually got this job through zip recruiter. Well I was put in contact with a recruiter who listed the job. Started as a contract and went direct after a year.\nHelper: Wow that sounds super interesting. You have nothing to lose going to upper management though with your concern. I have been in management and when employees came to me with concerns and showed me how much they cared about their job to take the time to bring me their input.\nSeeker: I've been looking but the market is flooded. I might just retire earlier than anticipated. take on some freelance to supplement my income. Upper management at my company is a bit...shall we say...uninterested in boat rockers.\nHelper: I understand that. Freelance does equal freedom. Research opportunities. You sound like a smart man.\nSeeker: Boeing is a place I'd love to finish our my career with but I went through a 2 year hiring process with them a few years ago. Once I was offered the position I had to decline because the move to Washington was not feasible at the time because of family issues. oh well.\nHelper: How does moving to WA. seem at this time? Boeing is an amazing company.\nSeeker: I'd do it. I think they have a hiring freeze on at the moment. Gulfstram in Georgia is close to me. They have been hiring contractors like gang busters.

One of my classes is extremely difficult and the professor has not been responsive at all. The TA is kind enough to make time to help me with homework, but my grades are still not great. It makes me feel really dumb and undeserving to be in that class\nHelper: So you are feeling as though you are in the wrong place? Do you feel as though you might fail your class completely?\nSeeker: I want to be in the program, it's just that I feel like everyone is so much smarter than me and my performance in that class makes me question my admission into the programs sometimes. When I feel like this after submitting homework, I end up crying because I just want to do well. I enjoy this field, just not this class in particular.

At the same time, I feel like it's unfair to compare myself to others.\nHelper: This sounds like it might be a self esteem issue and not about your grades. I have felt this sort of thing myself and I do know how awful it is to be so hard on yourself.\nSeeker: So what do I do about it? I don't want to keep feeling like this\nHelper: Have you thought about seeing a therapist? Does your school have any free therapy programmes you could use?\nSeeker: I don't think my school has free therapy programs. I have thought about seeing a therapist but I've heard therapy is very expensive.With student loans, I didn't really put much more research into therapy past hearing about the costs.\nHelper: I can see why the cost of therapy could be a concern, especially with student loans.

This has happened for as long as I can remember, even back when I was a little kid. Any friend i've ever had has just used me for SOME gain.

In some way shape or form- every person I become friends with uses me and throws me away when theyre done. Sometimes I feel like it must be me. Maybe i',m annoying? This happens so often the common denominator is ME. But i'm friendly, im assertive, im out spoken, im kind. I don't LET people walk all over me but it seems like that;s all I attract.\nHelper: So you feel under valued in your relationships because people tend to take advantage of you.\nSeeker: Pretty much. it just happens every single time.

That's a good reframe. I like that. I suppose, I'm just getting older and wish I had better, more stable options available to me. All this education hasn't really left with me many hard skills, I feel\nHelper: I am from North Carolina and in every city there are job centers, you can look them up by that title, they have people there who can help you find work based on your personality and skills. as well helping with resumes, interveiws, computers, all kinds of things.\nSeeker: Interesting. I guess I can look into that. I am from Ohio. That's not bad advice. I am somewhat kicking myself for paying so much money on education that wasn't really worth that much. I guess there isn't much I can do about that, though\nHelper: Im sorry you feel that way but education is never a wasted effort it can only make you level up even if you choose not to actively use what you acquire. Its always nice to have a big back up arsenal so you have options when something you want does turn up. Im really glad that suggestion might be helpful for you. Have you checked to see if any of the credits you have earned already are transferable to another degree you may find of interest?\nSeeker: I suppose there can be truth in that. I had a friend say that as well, that education is never a wasted effort. I agree sometimes. I should have thought about the program more before I went into it, but ah, oh well. Nothing I can do about it, now. No, it wouldn't be transferable. I have though about doing some grad school for something bio related. I don't know. I'm 30 now and getting burned out, to be honest.

I know this seems hard, but I believe that you can do it!\nSeeker: I will give it a try, but it's very hard for me to swallow the way she has treated me.\nHelper: People change sometimes and it is hard to understand. I want you to know that you are ENOUGH! You are smart and beautiful. Maybe it's time for this relationship to come to a close, but other people will come your way that will treat you like you deserve. I know it's painful now, but you will be stronger and better for going through this.\nSeeker: Thanks for understanding, I feel better now. I will give it sometime and if I don't feel like it or don't hear from her any more, I will take it that it's time to move on.\nHelper: I think that is a good approach. You will get through this!\nSeeker: You have been a big help and I can't thank you enough\nHelper: Anytime. I hope your feeling even a little better. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\nSeeker: No, you've helped enough already and I thank you once again for your support. I wish I had chatted with you sooner\nHelper: Aww, I am so glad that I was of help to you.\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [\"Empathy\"], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to maintain professionalism.

I am dissapointed in the teachers that I always get. They seem to make my courses so much harder. I think I just get incredibly unlucky at times.\nHelper: I see. You feel unlucky and disappointed that the teachers cause your courses to be challenging?\nSeeker: Exactly. I compare myself to my friends and, for example, they get barely any homework. It almost seems unfair.\nHelper: Course work is already stressful enough but to be challenging in addition only adds to the pressure.\nSeeker: Yeah. But I swear, every single one of my teachers just seems so imcompetent at times.\nHelper: I remember an English teacher of mine, always calling me out in class, saying that she expects better of me when my papers weren't the best. Her class was hard and I worked hard to complete my assignments as instructed. Instead of her speaking with me personally, she'd embarrass me. I did not like her class at all.\nSeeker: Those are the worst teachers. I wish teachers like those would get fired. I just want to have a chill time like most teenagers\nHelper: Is there enough time to maybe select more compatible teachers or speak with the school counselor about classes that work best for you?\nSeeker: That's the thing. I never get to pick my classes. And they always give me crap recommendations. I Think I need to drop by the office\nHelper: That is a great idea. I'd encourage you to speak with your school counselor to share your needs and maybe the 2 of you can come up with a plan to create a schedule with teachers that can help you be successful.\nSeeker: I am absolutely certain that I am capable of succeeding at school without over stressing. Hopefuly this will fix the issue.\nHelper: I believe you are correct! Less stress certainly creates a better learning environment. School counselors are your ally. Remember, you can go to them anytime you need them. Are you stopping by this week?\nSeeker: Maybe. If I have time on thursday or friday, I think I will go.\nHelper: I am so excited for you! This is a big step! Looking out for yourself, to assure you are happy, less stressed and learning the important things to be able to graduate.\nSeeker: I agree...\nHelper: For your next year, asking upperclassmen about their teachers can give you insight on who you may have next year. The more you know in advance, the better you can plan for what to discuss with your counselor. So proud of you! I know you 2 will come up with an awesome schedule!\nSeeker: Thank you. I will try my best.\nHelper: Good Luck!\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Structure\"]}",

Just because you guys are best friends all she sees in her head is that you're talking to another female. Maybe she also has her wall up and some insecurities that you can help her with.\nSeeker: I tried in many way to help her with that and proving her that my feelings toward her was pure. I basically stop talking to my best friend to gain her confidence. But it did not work. So it got to the point that nothing was the same. So she decided to move away and gave us some spaces and think this out\nHelper: How long have you two been together? Sometimes moving on from a relationship and staying single from some time can give you time to reflect and work on yourself for yourself. You never know the two of you might come back together stronger than before cause space might be all that your relationship needs at this moment. I know this might be so tough for you but l want you to know that you are never alone and you can do this. Maybe read a new book or pick up a new hobby for the time being.\nSeeker: We were together for two years. Im trying my best to go through this. I hope so. Thanks for all those words. It really helps\nHelper: You're doing the right thing by talking to someone about it. We are not meant to be alone in our thoughts because it can be a scary thing. Bottling up emotions is also never good so for you to reach out is very good and the first step to maybe feeling a little better. I've been in your same shoes and trust me it doesn't feel good so just know I am here for you and you can talk to me in confidence.\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [\"Empathy\", \"Validation\"], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to provide support and encouragement for the seeker's actions.

Maybe I should write her an email or something?My brother was a bully and so he is a big reason that I moved. My parents encouraged us to fight and argue, it wasn't a very fun place to live.

Once he let the gate open just so my dog would run away, he says he didn't do it but I know him and he is really mean and vengeful. He would also pull pranks on me that were just cruel.

It's like he doesn't believe science anymore\nHelper: Consider directing him to news sources that are not Twitter or Facebook, though I know this is hard to do. it is just a teensy bit funny he thinks that Trump is being muzzled on twitter when they are not deleting any of his tweets.\nSeeker: Yeah he thinks it's wrong that Twitter is flagging his tweets and he's mad that Facebook are taking down these groups that he feels are telling the truth\nHelper: This seems like a very sudden reaction from him, from what I've gathered, seeing as how it took you by surprise. Is there anything going on his life that may have put him into a negative mindset? Perhaps he's having problems in a relationship or at work that is leading him to rabbit holes on the internet.\nSeeker: He just got furloughed. Maybe like 3 weeks ago\nHelper: I'm so sorry to hear that. He might be struggling with that and looking to shift his negative feelings onto another issue, one that has the support of many. It could be providing him comfort to be angry at the suppression of Twitter rather than coming to terms with his own turmoil. I think talking to him about his job status might be a start in reasoning his new outlook.\nSeeker: I dunno. How do you think I should approach him about that?

How are you doing today?\nSeeker: I've been better to be honest. I think I need to break up with my girlfriend but she moved in last year and I don;' know how to approach it. I think I'm going to be in for a bad emotional time\nHelper: That seems like a tough situation! What feelings made you decide you need to breakup with her?\nSeeker: It's a bit of a mix. I don't find her attractive that much any more and I think that's important. Also since moving in she is difficult to live with. I can't see myself with her long term.\nHelper: I completely understand that. I recently broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year, because I didn't feel like I loved him as much as I used to. Things like that are important!. How long have you guys been together?\nSeeker: It's good that you have had a similar experience and understand what I'm going through. We dated for a while. The thing is she is Italian and has moved countries to live with me. I feel so bad that this has happened.\nHelper: Oh I see. That's a huge step to make in a relationship. So you are hesitant to break up with her because she moved just to be with you? Have you communicated with her about your concerns? Such as being difficult to live with?\nSeeker: Yes that's right, I helped her get a job and thought I'd just see how it goes. Her family loves me and thinks I'm great which makes this even more difficult. We have talked about things yes but she sees it as a bit of a joke I think.\nHelper: I think it's great that we got matched up, because I went through also the exact same situation. My boyfriend and I were long distance, and he moved across the country to be closer to me. So when I felt like we needed to break up, I was experiencing similar guilt that you are experiencing.\nSeeker: It's great that you understand this. I think being the man puts more pressure on me to look after her and make sure she. she's safe etc\nHelper: I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you. Things will be tough for a while, but you both will be able to grow from this experience. And just because you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, doesn't mean that you don't care about her!. Staying friends after the fact might take the pressure off of you a little bit. You can still help her out and be there for each other, but as friends instead of partner's.\nSeeker: To be honest, it's amazing that you have suggested this. It's really hard to balance my needs and feelings without breaking her heart. It's hard for the person that's dumped but actually I think it is equally hard for the dumper!\nHelper: Yes exactly! It's so difficult for the dumper as well, because of course you still have strong feelings for this person. They just aren't romantic anymore. And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love\nSeeker: That's exactly it. So do you think I should just talk to her and tell her how I feel? The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience.\nHelper: I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just \"kicking her to the curb.\" Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard\nSeeker: Yes, I think I need to emphasize the friends element of it and potentially support her to move on. I suppose I'm fearful that it will never end but I'll need to face into that and stay strong, and obviously avoid being intimate as this would really hurt her if I continued to sleep with her. I need to be careful about that I think!\nHelper: Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, I can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it.

But I swear, every single one of my teachers just seems so imcompetent at times.\nHelper: I remember an English teacher of mine, always calling me out in class, saying that she expects better of me when my papers weren't the best. Her class was hard and I worked hard to complete my assignments as instructed. Instead of her speaking with me personally, she'd embarrass me.

That can make you feel very close to someone. How is your relationship with your husband?\nSeeker: I have a wife and we have been together for 18 years, married for 5. I did alot of damage to our relationship when I was drinking and i'm not sure it will ever be the same\nHelper: Could you be transferring feelings because she has been there for you through a rough time and maybe you feel understood more than you do in your marriage? Can you talk to your wife about your feelings openly?\nSeeker: about having feelings for another woman? NO...we have tried some marriage counseling apps things get better then go back.\nHelper: I am sorry to hear that. I was also married at one time and had similar issues. We never could get passed some issued like having kids or not. I understand it can be difficult coming to terms with someone. It doesn't always work out.\nSeeker: I have changed a great deal in the past 2.5 years even though it's been for the better it's difficult for my wife to reconcile the old and new\nHelper: That makes a lot of sense and good for you. That's an awesome testament to your hard work.Does your mentor feel the same way about you?\nSeeker: I never intended to have these feelings for my friend...it just developed over time. I would never tell her though and ruin our friendship.\nHelper: Do you have sense that she has deeper feelings for you and that might be what you are picking up on and contributing to your feelings?\nSeeker: we have a very unique, strong loving, friendship that is completely platonic. she is happily married and has a strong faith, would never cheat.\nHelper: Have you considered getting a mentor who you don't have strong feelings for and slowing down your friendship?\nSeeker: I don't want to cheat either let me clarify that because i never want to ruin our friendship...but I do need to deal with these feelings\nHelper: I can understand. Have you ever consider starting a journal. A place to write your deepest secrets?\nSeeker: I have actually mentioned before that I think about distancing myself at times because i have never had such an influential friendship and she tells me she needs me as much as i need her and that she waited her whole life to find a friend like me... I don't journal anymore but I do write alot of poetry to work through things\nHelper: It sounds like you're trying to balance your friendship with your feelings.

I think I will speak to one of my friends about this ,he's normally pretty good with that kind of thing.\nHelper: yes it's really good to talk it through with someone first just really understand if trying to restart your old relationship is the right thing to do for you.\nSeeker: I think I conversation has actually helped me understand my motivations a little better. you have also given me some good suggestions so thank you for that\nHelper: I'm happy to hear that. you seem like a really decent person and I'm sure you will make the right decision and I'm positive you can get past this!\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Validation\", \"Empathy\"]}",

I ask him to give me the details for an assignment he never sent the details for and he always ignores it. I do n't think he even has the assignment instructions recorded anywhere.\nHelper: Is there anyone in your class that you are close to that you can reach out to?\nSeeker: We have a Discord server set up for the class where we're all trying to make sense of the class and our professor because it has been such a bad experience for all of us.

Want to share why you're feeling that way?\nSeeker: Sure, I guess \"venting\" is pretty much all I have that I can do at this point.\nHelper: Do you feel like you can't take any actions in the situation?\nSeeker: Long story short - at work, a new boss pulled all the leadership OUT of the jobs they were hired for (some more than 12 years ago - so they have lots of experience) and shuffled them all around to new jobs - all that is except the 5 oldest employees - they got moved into \"non-positions\". No longer supervising anyone, only doing grunt work, etc. It ticks me off and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm working on a *possible* action - RETIREMENT from this job. Only problem is - bad time to be doing that; pressure to keep my income up until my daughter graduates college, etc.\nHelper: That sounds frustrating, especially if you're one of the employees affected and when the new boss doesn't seem to know what he/she is doing with the reorganization. That's positive, though, that you at least have a strategy in mind with retirement, even if this may not be the best time right now.\nSeeker: She has a \"plan\", I guess, but it isn't being articulated that well, and these actions are demonstrating poor \"people management\" and seem to be both confusing lots of folks, and professionally insulting many others. Oh, and by the way, things are running WORSE than they were before, but it's being blamed on COVID. Problem with the \"retirement strategy\" is that it means going out on a limb with no job with the holidays coming up, and with COVID with no end in sight.

In the beginning, I was doing fine and he was having a really hard time. But now I miss him more than anything and he is now better off without me\nHelper: Wow...that does sound painful.

I have been miserable.\nHelper: It sounds like you have been treated very poorly, do you agree with that?\nSeeker: Yes I have and everyone says to move on. I just don't know how to let her go in my head and heart. If she called me today and said come back I probably would go. I know I'm weak. I just love her.\nHelper: Are there potential financial issues or do you think she'd be prepared to reach an amicable settlement?\nSeeker: No we just got married earlier this year. We never even got around to putting our finances together. So I'm good there. Thank goodness\nHelper: She does not seem to have stayed true to her marriage vows for very long!\nSeeker: No and it shocks me because she was so against not getting a divorce. We think (her bff and sister) that she may be using drugs.\nHelper: Wow that is very difficult. There are support agencies out there that can help the friends and family of addicts, I believe. Would you consider them?\nSeeker: I would. She won't even talk to me though. When I try to call and talk to her this other woman (the lady she's cheating on me with) answers her phone and will not let me talk to her.\nHelper: It seems like you're feeling really hurt and frustrated by this situation. How are you coping?\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Questions\", \"Reflections\"]}",

It came on suddenly at a nail salon after I had an allergic reaction to a chemical in acrylic nails. Originally the doctors thought it was brain inflammation. What suggestions do you have for improving it? Meditation? Exercise? I do art. And never have anxiety when I'm painting, however, I cannot exactly do that at the store\nHelper: Have you thought about looking for support groups with people who also have anxiety about being in public?\nSeeker: I have and I did\nHelper: Have you thought about brining a friend with you to the store? Someone you are comfortable with? Having someone you are comfortable with may help to calm the anxiety while you are out.\nSeeker: Support groups don't really help stop the Panic Attacks. They cause all sorts of sensations. Fast heart rate, chills, shakes, My brain feels foggy and impersonal. I do go to the store often with my fiance :). That has helped a lot\nHelper: It sounds like your experience can be really overwhelming, especially with the different sensations you described.

I already have to work about 55 hours/week. I do mturk to pay my phone bill (sort of a bet with my wife lol). I'm wanting to maybe move into freelance work but the market is flooded because of covid. So many working from home and freelancing these days.\nHelper: You are right. I feel your anxiety in this. Competition is high in all industries right now it seems. Maybe sign up with those employment sites online. Indeed, ZipRecuiter, etc...it can't hurt to see what other options are out there.\nSeeker: Not sure what is going to happen to my industry. The demand for new products is astounding. For example we have been working on cargo holds for aircraft that replaces seats and maintains social distancing protocols. I actually got this job through zip recruiter. Well I was put in contact with a recruiter who listed the job. Started as a contract and went direct after a year.\nHelper: Wow that sounds super interesting. You have nothing to lose going to upper management though with your concern. I have been in management and when employees came to me with concerns and showed me how much they cared about their job to take the time to bring me their input.\nSeeker: I've been looking but the market is flooded. I might just retire earlier than anticipated. take on some freelance to supplement my income. Upper management at my company is a bit...shall we say...uninterested in boat rockers.\nHelper: I understand that. Freelance does equal freedom. Research opportunities. You sound like a smart man.\nSeeker: Boeing is a place I'd love to finish our my career with but I went through a 2 year hiring process with them a few years ago. Once I was offered the position I had to decline because the move to Washington was not feasible at the time because of family issues. oh well.\nHelper: How does moving to WA. seem at this time? Boeing is an amazing company.\nSeeker: I'd do it. I think they have a hiring freeze on at the moment. Gulfstram in Georgia is close to me. They have been hiring contractors like gang busters. Problem is that is a terrible company. chew you up and spit you out. What industry were you a manger in?\nHelper: Advertising. Sounds like you have options. Hang tight for the next few months and see where the world is headed. Time are so uncertain right now, but hey, it can only get better from here.\nSeeker: advertising and marketing are so competitive. Yes I think after the first of the year I'll make some changes.

Teenagers tend to get very very involved in their appearance :D I used to spend an hour in the shower each day\nSeeker: Unfortunately I have spoiled her rotten so that she has most everything she could want (well, not an I-phone and nintendo switch! lol)\nHelper: Perhaps you could gently explain to her why it's anti social to not shower for a week?\nSeeker: I think she is getting very close to the age where she will pay attention to herself and general appearance, but she's not there yet.\nHelper: Ah you have all the fun of her teenage years to look forward to. I would not go through that again :D\nSeeker: I have, lol. She is getting much better about putting clean underwear on everyday at least.\nHelper: Well that is definitely something!!. Maybe try to help her take pride in her appearance? Give her some make up lessons?\nSeeker: She also loves to go through my personal things. Takes my nail clippers. Tries on my blush and lipstick.

She hates to brush her own hair but could sit for for an hour while I brush her hair! lol. Yes, for the most part.\nHelper: Maybe you could treat her to a new haircut, give her a new pride in herself?\nSeeker: With the pandemic, we have not been out too much. I gave her a much needed haircut about a month ago. Trimmed off about six inches, but it's still way past her shoulders. We will hopefully go for a professional cut soon. I need one too!. That is a very good idea.\nHelper: Oh of course I had forgotten about the pandemic. It seems ages since we had normal life!\nSeeker: Agreed!.

I feel that I made a mistake coming back to school to get a PhD.\nHelper: So, to reiterate, you are suffering from anxiety due to school? Or is your anxiousness also caused by other life factors as well?\nSeeker: School is the start of the problem. I know that if I quit I can still be successful elsewhere but I also feel if I quit I will let my wife and kids down who were willing to leave family and friends to follow me to the school I wanted to go to.\nHelper: I understand what you are going through. It is as if you are being pulled in two directions, but are not sure which is the best option at the given moment. I think it is great that you wanted to go back to school, but if your heart is not in it, then it may not be what you should continue pursuing.\nSeeker: I know I want this though. I enjoy what I do and what I would do for my career if I graduate. I mainly feel inadequate. I feel that I am not good enough. I am willing to do whatever it takes but fear that whatever my \"best\" is may not be good enough.\nHelper: I can feel your worries when you speak about your anxiety, and I am hoping we can find a way to approach your feelings. Do you think there was a specific instance that is causing doubts within yourself or is it in your nature to self-doubt?\nSeeker: It is in my nature to self doubt. Additionally, I have had a few bumps in the road during my program and struggle to pick myself up after those bumps. For example, I am on academic probation and have a certain expectation over the next few months that I have to hit to stay in the program due to struggles in previous classes. I am reaching the bar just fine, according to those that I work with, and often feel I am doing quite well but occasionally I start to panic and think that I am not doing as well as I think that I am and start to spiral\nHelper: This has also been a past struggle of mine, and I think it partially stems from the bar we set so high for ourselves. We obviously cannot reach the top right away, but have to work our way up. Often times, when facing an obstacle, such as a bad grade, we might retreat further down the path due to fear that it will keep happening. I know that I personally had a tendency to think of my family and friends who I feel are dependent on me or comparing myself with others when the only person we should think of in these instances is ourself. When making progress, tiny steps upward matter more than you think. But when we take a step backward, we cannot fall back down to the starting point by letting our doubts pile upon one another.\nSeeker: That is a really good point and helpful. Thank you!\nHelper: Of course, I am happy to help! I have noticed that letting yourself celebrate a good grade can be really helpful to feel that you are enough and making good progress. But when things do go south, because life certainly happens, we must stay in the present and live life like we usually would, with a drive that we are going to push harder against whatever we have to face next.\nSeeker: That is exactly right. I need to focus more on what progress has been made and not on what progress hasn't been made yet because there is still time to make that progress.\nHelper: Exactly! I also suggest if you are having doubts, talk it out with someone like your partner or a close friend. They can often provide a pick me up you didn't even know you needed. More than anything, give yourself credit and relax. Take some time to just breathe and release the tension. I guarantee it will leave you feeling refreshed and fulfilled for the next tasks you have to face. I believe you can do this and I feel that you believe it too, which is amazing.

So, Dr. Freud, tell me about your love life.... LOL. Just kidding. I feel ya. I want to learn trust, but I don't know when the right conditions will return.\nHelper: you are hurt because she broke up with you... that will make you stronger and be more attentive next time. and if everyone was born and met thier solemate it would be odd. life is about ups and downs. by the time you find mrs right, all these idiots that were not good for you will help turn you into the perfect person for the one that wont break your heart\nSeeker: True.

I think I need to break up with my girlfriend but she moved in last year and I don;' know how to approach it. I think I'm going to be in for a bad emotional time\nHelper: That seems like a tough situation! What feelings made you decide you need to breakup with her?\nSeeker: It's a bit of a mix. I don't find her attractive that much any more and I think that's important. Also since moving in she is difficult to live with. I can't see myself with her long term.\nHelper: I completely understand that. I recently broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year, because I didn't feel like I loved him as much as I used to. Things like that are important!. How long have you guys been together?\nSeeker: It's good that you have had a similar experience and understand what I'm going through. We dated for a while. The thing is she is Italian and has moved countries to live with me. I feel so bad that this has happened.\nHelper: Oh I see. That's a huge step to make in a relationship. So you are hesitant to break up with her because she moved just to be with you? Have you communicated with her about your concerns? Such as being difficult to live with?\nSeeker: Yes that's right, I helped her get a job and thought I'd just see how it goes. Her family loves me and thinks I'm great which makes this even more difficult. We have talked about things yes but she sees it as a bit of a joke I think.\nHelper: I think it's great that we got matched up, because I went through also the exact same situation. My boyfriend and I were long distance, and he moved across the country to be closer to me. So when I felt like we needed to break up, I was experiencing similar guilt that you are experiencing.\nSeeker: It's great that you understand this. I think being the man puts more pressure on me to look after her and make sure she. she's safe etc\nHelper: I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you. Things will be tough for a while, but you both will be able to grow from this experience. And just because you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, doesn't mean that you don't care about her!. Staying friends after the fact might take the pressure off of you a little bit. You can still help her out and be there for each other, but as friends instead of partner's.\nSeeker: To be honest, it's amazing that you have suggested this. It's really hard to balance my needs and feelings without breaking her heart. It's hard for the person that's dumped but actually I think it is equally hard for the dumper!\nHelper: Yes exactly! It's so difficult for the dumper as well, because of course you still have strong feelings for this person. They just aren't romantic anymore. And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love\nSeeker: That's exactly it. So do you think I should just talk to her and tell her how I feel? The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience.\nHelper: I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just \"kicking her to the curb.\" Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard\nSeeker: Yes, I think I need to emphasize the friends element of it and potentially support her to move on. I suppose I'm fearful that it will never end but I'll need to face into that and stay strong, and obviously avoid being intimate as this would really hurt her if I continued to sleep with her. I need to be careful about that I think!\nHelper: Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, I can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it. But I think you are going to be able to do that just fine!\nSeeker: I must say, you have been fantastic to talk to about this, we have had a similar experience so I think the advice is coming from experience. Thanks for that!\nHelper: What I've gathered about you as a person, makes me confident that you probably chose a partner that will be able to have this talk with you and you both will come to an understanding. Yes I think it's very great we were able to connect on our issues! It definitely helps. You are welcome! :)\nSeeker: Thank you for a great conversation. To continue as is wouldn't be fair on her and I see that now.\nHelper: Of course! And it wouldn't be fair to her, just as much as it wouldn't be fair to you. Your happiness is just as important!\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Empathy\", \"Validation\"]}",

What brings you here today?\nSeeker: I am having a hard time with the realization that my once strong friendships are no longer as strong. I feel disconnected with them. The limitations the pandemic has set for all of us have been great. I am unsure if I will ever regain those friendships\nHelper: I understand that. The pandemic has been very hard to keep connected with everyone. Have you tried talking to your friends about how you are feeling?\nSeeker: Yes, I have tried to message them daily, but the responses have always been clipped and or the response comes after couple days. I do feel other friendships have formed within each community, feeling a bit left out. I feel silly, like a teenage girl, who wants to be included. Just want to feel as though I am still part of their lives.\nHelper: It's completely normal to feel like that. I have been in your exact shoes. I would suggest inviting one of them out for lunch or dinner and express face to face how you are feeling right now.\nSeeker: I was thinking the same thing, but I am unsure I feel awkward now, I feel like I do not them as I thought I did. I am unsure why I feel this way. one of them is my daughters god mother and the text are there but they are not like they use.. I am unsure if I should ask why she has time for others and not us... just saying it makes me feel weird. anyone there?\nHelper: She may be going through something at home or having family issues. We truly never know what the other person is going through unless we have that uncomfortable situation. My suggestion would be to rephrase that question slightly to her.\nSeeker: I agree with you, just seems really strange since we were inseparable before the pandemic. I am also aware many are going through this situation just thought my friendships were stronger and distant would not be an issue. I will, never did I think I would hesitate whats going on..\nHelper: It's completely natural. Instead of texting her, have you tried calling?\nSeeker: Yes, I have. The conversation have been superficial, like small talk. There is nothing to share, I am guessing. My daughter has had lots of dance functions despite the pandemic and yet I have not felt supported. Perhaps shes not okay with venturing out during the pandemic.. though I do see on social media shes meeting other friends in social settings. Perhaps I need to be more open and not be so distant? Maybe its me and I am not seeing it?\nHelper: How long have you been friends?\nSeeker: we are both 35 and we met in pre K. we are lifetime friends. shes a sister to me. At some point our parents use to live in the same apartment complex, our parents are great friends as well. I was there for her babies birth, when she found out what she was having. We have shared grand moments together.\nHelper: You both have been friends for such a long time and have shared many important life moments.

There is so much homework for a little child.\nHelper: Perhaps you can find out which classes your child struggles with and contact the teacher(s) or school to set up a conference? I know some schools even have peer tutors they say help pair students with!\nSeeker: I'm thinking about tutoring possibly but being home and going to school it is so overwhelming already and to add tutoring to the list is another question for me.\nHelper: My children are five and eight.

I am unsure if I should ask why she has time for others and not us... just saying it makes me feel weird. anyone there?\nHelper: She may be going through something at home or having family issues. We truly never know what the other person is going through unless we have that uncomfortable situation. My suggestion would be to rephrase that question slightly to her.\nSeeker: I agree with you, just seems really strange since we were inseparable before the pandemic.

I will, never did I think I would hesitate whats going on..\nHelper: It's completely natural. Instead of texting her, have you tried calling?\nSeeker: Yes, I have. The conversation have been superficial, like small talk. There is nothing to share, I am guessing. My daughter has had lots of dance functions despite the pandemic and yet I have not felt supported. Perhaps shes not okay with venturing out during the pandemic.. though I do see on social media shes meeting other friends in social settings. Perhaps I need to be more open and not be so distant? Maybe its me and I am not seeing it?\nHelper: How long have you been friends?\nSeeker: we are both 35 and we met in pre K. we are lifetime friends. shes a sister to me. At some point our parents use to live in the same apartment complex, our parents are great friends as well. I was there for her babies birth, when she found out what she was having. We have shared grand moments together.\nHelper: You both have been friends for such a long time. I'm so jealous of friendships like that. I would definitely ask her for lunch. You all have been through so much together. This conversation with her would be a weight off your shoulders.\nSeeker: Yes, shes the serious one and I am the loud and carefree one. So having our roles a bit reverse has me a bit, weirded out. I am an only child, and perhaps that makes me feel extremely unconfident. I am sure if asked, she would respond I am just being needy. eh, I will ask, since the pandemic ive only seen her once.\nHelper: I do not think she would respond that way at all. Once she sees that this has you concerned about your friendship, she will take it serious and open up to you.\nSeeker: You are right! thank you for the reinsurance.

Was this a mutual agreement?\nSeeker: Well technically it was a mutual agreement but i feel like I dont want this to happen. So what are you up to? Hello? Are you there?\nHelper: Was there a reasoning behind your decision? Sometimes we let our anger and emotions make our decisions for us.\nSeeker: Well. Basically all started for jealousy and she saw a couple of text messages of my best friend and she misunderstood the conversation and since then its not the same. She doesnt trust me\nHelper: I see trust is a very important key factor in relationships and without it the relationship stays stagnant. Have you tried reassuring her that your intentions are pure and maybe gave her some words of affirmation that would let her know how you truly feel about her? Just because you guys are best friends all she sees in her head is that you're talking to another female. Maybe she also has her wall up and some insecurities that you can help her with.\nSeeker: I tried in many way to help her with that and proving her that my feelings toward her was pure. I basically stop talking to my best friend to gain her confidence. But it did not work. So it got to the point that nothing was the same. So she decided to move away and gave us some spaces and think this out\nHelper: How long have you two been together? Sometimes moving on from a relationship and staying single from some time can give you time to reflect and work on yourself for yourself. You never know the two of you might come back together stronger than before cause space might be all that your relationship needs at this moment.

Have you reached out to any friends to talk about how you're feeling?\nSeeker: i have rented seperately. i reached to my friends but no use of that.\nHelper: Knowing you have a safe place to live is one positive aspect of your life!\nSeeker: yes i am safe\nHelper: I understand that it's a challenging time for you.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGive feedback to the Helper's last response.\n\n### Input:\nSeeker: I just had a baby 2 months ago and I have been struggling with my physical appearance and dealing with my mental health.\nHelper: Is part of that the weight gain from pregnancy? And what sort of mental health challenges are you having? Both of these problems are very common for new mothers. I'm sorry to hear you are going through this, it sounds like a very tough time for you.\nSeeker: I didnt keep much weight from the pregnancy but its the loose skin that makes it very challenging to accept and to love my self.\nHelper: Oh that is understandable. I am a mother, and remember worrying about the same thing.\nSeeker: My depression has gotten worse since having my son. I feel a constant feeling that i'm not a good mother. I feel worthless and having a constant feeling that I don't deserve my son\nHelper: I can tell you from personal experience that loose skin, stretch marks, and loosening of \"other parts\" do all self correct with time. You will feel better about your body again when they do.\nSeeker: How did you cope with post partum?\nHelper: I was fortunate not to experience depresion. But I totally went through self doubt, wondering if I was being a good enough mother, and feeling \"not up to\" the task....it's the hardest job in the world, being a mom, and so exhausting the first while. Have you spoken to your doctor about how depressed you are feeling?\nSeeker: Yes. I mentioned it to them at my 6 week pp check up. I was prescribed to a med to help but I dont think its fully in its works yet.\nHelper: Antidepressants can take a couple of weeks to kick in, I am on them too; I hope you will find them helpful. It's hard waiting for them to work!. Do you have someone helping you with the baby or are you a single mom? The best advice I can share from my experience as a new mom was find someone to give you breaks. Whether that be a partner, a friend, a family member, or even a baby sitter if that's possible. Its important to take time to rest and recharge an nurture yourself, whether that be a nap, a bubble bath, a walk or whatever has made you feel good in the past.\nSeeker: Thank you, I hope so too. Yes I have my husband helping me. I am a stay at home mom while he goes to work. Im lucky that I am able to stay home with our son but at the same time its hard because because theres a less opportunity to have a break and on top of that he works 12 hour shifts so I rarley get to spend time with my husband. I took my first break 2 days ago with my husband. We went on a day road trip and it felt really good to have that day to have together away from the baby but at the same time it was hard leaving our baby.\nHelper: Oh that's a long shift...I'm glad you have someone at home to help when he can. It may seem impossible but you are stronger than you think...you've got this. hey that's great that you had a road trip! And yes it's hard to trust someone else with our wee ones...but so necessary both for you and for your marriage too\nSeeker: Thank you, I really appreciate it. Its nice to be able to talk about it.\nHelper: I have one other suggestion before I go, have you any mother and baby groups in your area? Something you may want to research. It's been a pleasure speaking with you, you are so welcome. Know that as hard as it is, these feelings can be a normal experience for a new mother, and you will get through it.\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [\"Empathy\"], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to acknowledge the seeker's gratitude.

I'm pretty good today, what about you?\nHelper: I'm doing really well, thanks. What brings you here today?\nSeeker: I'm just having some old thoughts about a past relationship. IT's making me sad\nHelper: I can appreciate that. Thinking about lost loves makes me sad too!. What about this particular relationship makes you feel sad?\nSeeker: Yeahhh I re read some old messages from a while back and just started thinking about it again. IT's going to sound quite dramatic, but I regret breaking up with this person. I feel as though they were my soulmate. And I ruined it\nHelper: Oh...I see, you think s/he's the \"one who got away?\". Why did you break up?\nSeeker: Pretty much... but the dumb thing about that is I am the one who broke it off. I was with him since beginning of high school, and so I never knew anything other than him. But Earlier this year I was having second thoughts and thought we should try new things for a while. In the beginning, I was doing fine and he was having a really hard time. But now I miss him more than anything and he is now better off without me\nHelper: Wow...that does sound painful. I know how hard it is to let go of a guy you really loved. I've had to break up with a few of them over the years!\nSeeker: Yeah? Do you miss any of them? Or do you feel like it was right for you in the long run\nHelper: In the long run, I feel that those break-ups were absolutely necessary. I'm in a really good place now. And they are too.\nSeeker: Yeah that is good. That is everything that I'm hoping for. But it's not coming fast enough\nHelper: I eventually learned to think of it like this: every man I loved taught me something important about myself. ANd I taught them things about themselves. ANd it doesn't happen overnight. But eventually, you will probably be able to see how you grew as a result of the breakup. Maybe the things you will learn can help you be ready for Mr Right!\nSeeker: I really appreciate that way of looking at it. Of course I will always cherish my memories and the things I learned from him. And I want to think of those things as happy experiences rather than sad memories\nHelper: That's a really good way of looking at it.\nSeeker: How long did it typically take you to finalyl be over them and happy with what you ecperienced?\nHelper: Oohh.... I think it really depended on how long I was with them. ANd why I decided to end it. The longer relationships Maybe a few weeks to a few months before I was ready to move on and try again. BUt Only a fraction of that was crying with Ben & Jerry's!\nSeeker: Hahaha yes. That really does help honestly !\nHelper: For me it just happened that one day, I thought about Gary and I didn't really feel that sad anymore. I just thought...wow, we had some good times. B&J's and a few good rom-coms ought to put you in a better mood! Lol\nSeeker: Yeah I guess I am just waiting for that day when my thoughts are genuinely me just grateful for the times we shared but not missing them. And honestly, some days I do feel like that! And then it all comes back. I think I am getting there\nHelper: It sounds like you're making progress.

This upsets me and I have talked to them about it but they still do not care.\nHelper: So you feel that you are being put in danger by the actions of your room-mate?\nSeeker: Yes, absolutely. I do not want to get covid and am worried about long term health effects. I have shared this with them but they still do not care.\nHelper: I can totally understand how you feel. I absolutely hate how some people are pretending that the pandemic is not real and they do not need to worry.\nSeeker: Also, I am in a triple room in my sorority house for clarification. I feel my risk getting it in the room is high if they continue to not respect guidelines.\nHelper: Do not worry, your fears are totally grounded. Some people really just need to grow up and get educated.\nSeeker: I agree and appreciate that I am not alone in thinking that!. Many college students have been very irresponsible during the pandemic which is upsetting to me.\nHelper: Is there anyone at your college who could help you with this? Perhaps move you into a single room?\nSeeker: No, there aren't any sorority rooms available at my sorority house and all of the dorms/apartments are full already but I've tried. **single not sorority\nHelper: It sounds like you're really concerned about your health and safety. Would you like to brainstorm some strategies for dealing with this situation?\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Reflections\", \"Empathy\", \"Professionalism\"]}",

I'd love to talk about my current dilemma in my friend circle.\nHelper: Can you share the dilemma you are having?\nSeeker: Basically. This has happened for as long as I can remember, even back when I was a little kid. Any friend i've ever had has just used me for SOME gain. Whether that be boredom, money, or an emotional support pillow. I'm so sick of it. They'll literally ignore me for months and randomly text me for money. If i respond theyll read my messages then ignore me until they need money again. Or, they'll use me to throw alllll their problems onto me and never do the same for me. In some way shape or form- every person I become friends with uses me and throws me away when theyre done. Sometimes I feel like it must be me. Maybe i',m annoying? This happens so often the common denominator is ME. But i'm friendly, im assertive, im out spoken, im kind. I don't LET people walk all over me but it seems like that;s all I attract.\nHelper: So you feel under valued in your relationships because people tend to take advantage of you.\nSeeker: Pretty much. it just happens every single time. It's kind of discouraging and just makes me an angry person\nHelper: It sounds like this is really bothering you. It is good that you are talking about it though. Have you tried telling them how they make you feel?\nSeeker: Some of them. The others I never even get a chance because they just ignore my existence anytime I try and reach out to talk. I've just been waiting for them to pour their problems onto me or have the nerve to ask for money. Then i'll tell them. I already know they won't respond but atleast ill say my peace\nHelper: After you tell them how you feel do you still give them money or listen to what's going on and try to help them.\nSeeker: No. Whenever I do get to say my peace, i'll just cut contact completely. Lately i've been holding it in and just barely responding if at all. I've told one of them that i have no money and she hasn't contacted me since. But if she tries again i'll say something about the issue. I don't like feeling used. Who even has the nerve to blatantly use somebody like that? It's irritating\nHelper: It's good that you let them know how you feel. By doing that, you are taking the first step in now allowing them to take advantage of you\nSeeker: Agreed. I just hope that one day I can meet people and form actual friendships with them\nHelper: It's really hard to stand up for yourself but it sounds like you are off to a good start. Have you taken any steps in trying to form new more meaningful relationships\nSeeker: I thought I did. My husband and I made a couple friends. Theyre a couple and so are we so we go on double dates but they seem more drawn to him. Me and the other girl got very close and then boom she randomly decided she only wants to talk to me when shes mad or bored\nHelper: That sounds frustrating.

I told my best friends that I never want to see her again though. My boyfriend and I have plans to get engaged this month. I am furious at him though.\nHelper: That's a tough situation. How do you feel about the plans to get engaged after what you found out?\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Self-disclosure\"]}",

I have only called her severally, sent her message via whatsapp and facebook.\nHelper: It might be an option. Maybe just lay out how you feel in it, and just ask her for an explanation perhaps. It might be good to let her know that \"I understand it's over, but could you help me understand why so that I can close this chapter\" - perhaps she would respond to something like that. If she doesn't, then you are going to have to make some hard decisions and try to process this. It's a very hard position to be in, but life is too beautiful to be miserable, and I know you would rather be happy.\nSeeker: Sure i also want to be happy but we have shared so much in common and were in process of starting something good to help generate income. She had the idea and i had the capital. I feel this will really be a wasted opprtunity. Is there anything else i can do to salvage the situation?\nHelper: You are going to have to lay it all on the line with her, but be prepared for her to not respond in the way that you want. Sometimes we do the best we can, and it still doesn't change the situation. Just know that her decision does not mean you are unworthy, it just means that she is not worthy of you - but someone else is and then it would be time to go and find them.\nSeeker: Wow. This is interesting. Thanks for this reminder. I gonna consider this idea and move on then. Thanks for this support\nHelper: You are more than welcome.

That is were you need to punch in an opportunity to seek help from a professional and convince her in such a way she will come down and accept it.\nSeeker: I have encouraged her to set up appointments with professionals. Sometimes she has, but does not follow through, the addiction gets in the way, it's more powerful than her desire to stop. And I can't just drive her/ accompany her to an appointment because she lives in a different city. But yes, I am happy she trusts me enough to confide in me\nHelper: You have such a good heart so hang in there she will come to you with a bang.\nSeeker: i really appreciate your encouragement. i have been feeling worn down by it and your encouragement helps. have you any other suggestions for me?\nHelper: I'm really glad my encouragement could help!

Thank you. May I ask what helped you move forward?\nHelper: I thought of the good times that we spent together. What are some of your happy memories with your fiance?\nSeeker: Some of my favorites are playing games together or watching movies. Curling up on the couch. He had kidney failure, so we didn't do much outside, but spent as much time together as we could. He used to call me his sunshiney baby doll. Whenever I see sunflowers I think of him. But most of all, it was that he loved me. He loved me for me ... he didn't want me to be anyone or anything else. That was a miracle.\nHelper: That is so sweet.

I tend to be clumsy at the best of times and have done things such as (most recently) dropping a scalding bowl of chili on my foot.

All the Puerto Rican family members consider themselves to be allies of the blacks, I do not. I have been repeatedly victimized by black people,\nHelper: How have you been victimized by black people? When those events happen how did that make you feel\nSeeker: I have been robbed at gunpoint three times in the past 8 months while walking home from work. Each time, it was one or more black males with guns who robbed me. They would call me racial slurs every time too. Also, my wife was raped by a black homeless man in July 2020 while she was jogging in the park. This made me get so angry, that I burned down a low-income housing building that was occupied by only black residents. I tried to get even with the blacks for what happened to my wife.

No black woman has been raped by a white man in recent history, even DOJ crime statistics back me up on this one. When is the last time anyone remembers a pack of white men raping a black lady?

I could be much better.\nHelper: How are you feeling? Is there anything the matter?\nSeeker: I am feeling really down today. My fiance was cheating on me and everything has pretty much crumbled all around me.\nHelper: Oh my I'm so sorry that happened to you. I can't completely relate, but my parents are going through something very similar after 25 years of marriage. Tell me more about it.\nSeeker: I'm glad you haven't and so sorry to hear about them. We have been together for 13 years and have an 11 year old. He has been dating someone for nearly two years and i had no clue. I am so embarrassed and feel so stupid.\nHelper: I am so sorry. Does your child know? I have a 10 year old and she is struggling with my parents, we lived with them for the first 2 years of her life and have always been 15 minutes away since. I completely understand why you feel the way you do that is to be expected. You are not stupid and I'm sure its not you. Have you spoken to your fiance about this since you found out?\nSeeker: He is somewhat aware that something is going on but not quite sure what. One of us will be moving out so it will need to be explained to him soon. We have talked and he just denies everything. He told me I'm crazy and they are just \"friends. I would love to believe that but unfortunately I know that isn't true. I'm just overwhelmed with so may questions that he is not answering.\nHelper: I'm so sorry. From personal experience, my best advice is to be as direct as possible. Demand respect and answers that you deserve after 13 years. If he will not answer your questions, thats all the answers you need. How did you find out? I can't even imagine how you feel. Clarity and answers are so important right now for you... no matter if it is true or not. That is a long time to be with someone.\nSeeker: That is great advice! It's very hard to stand up for yourself sometimes especially when you are emotionally devastated. I visited him unannounced at work one day and they were having lunch together. I had no idea who she was and she got up and ran off. Upon further investigation, I checked phone records, receipts, any other thing I could find and all the evidence was there. two hour conversations, gifts from women's stores that weren't given to me.\nHelper: That must have been so hard to discover, and it's completely normal to feel devastated. It sounds like you're not getting the answers you need from him. How are you handling this? Have you been able to share this with anyone else who is supportive?\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Questions\", \"Reflections\", \"Empathy\"]}",

How are you doing today?\nSeeker: I've been better to be honest. I think I need to break up with my girlfriend but she moved in last year and I don;' know how to approach it. I think I'm going to be in for a bad emotional time\nHelper: That seems like a tough situation! What feelings made you decide you need to breakup with her?\nSeeker: It's a bit of a mix. I don't find her attractive that much any more and I think that's important. Also since moving in she is difficult to live with. I can't see myself with her long term.\nHelper: I completely understand that. I recently broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year, because I didn't feel like I loved him as much as I used to. Things like that are important!. How long have you guys been together?\nSeeker: It's good that you have had a similar experience and understand what I'm going through. We dated for a while. The thing is she is Italian and has moved countries to live with me. I feel so bad that this has happened.\nHelper: Oh I see. That's a huge step to make in a relationship. So you are hesitant to break up with her because she moved just to be with you? Have you communicated with her about your concerns? Such as being difficult to live with?\nSeeker: Yes that's right, I helped her get a job and thought I'd just see how it goes. Her family loves me and thinks I'm great which makes this even more difficult. We have talked about things yes but she sees it as a bit of a joke I think.\nHelper: I think it's great that we got matched up, because I went through also the exact same situation. My boyfriend and I were long distance, and he moved across the country to be closer to me. So when I felt like we needed to break up, I was experiencing similar guilt that you are experiencing.\nSeeker: It's great that you understand this. I think being the man puts more pressure on me to look after her and make sure she. she's safe etc\nHelper: I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you. Things will be tough for a while, but you both will be able to grow from this experience. And just because you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, doesn't mean that you don't care about her!. Staying friends after the fact might take the pressure off of you a little bit. You can still help her out and be there for each other, but as friends instead of partner's.\nSeeker: To be honest, it's amazing that you have suggested this. It's really hard to balance my needs and feelings without breaking her heart. It's hard for the person that's dumped but actually I think it is equally hard for the dumper!\nHelper: Yes exactly! It's so difficult for the dumper as well, because of course you still have strong feelings for this person. They just aren't romantic anymore. And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love\nSeeker: That's exactly it. So do you think I should just talk to her and tell her how I feel? The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience.\nHelper: I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just \"kicking her to the curb.\" Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties.

It's been a long stressful month of discussion. The problem is I don't share their beliefs, and I haven't been really \"saving myself\". I'm been living away from them for collage quite a while and I've been basically doing stuff that if they found out they would be very upset about.

Thanks for reminding me. I think I worry more about the outcome than I need too.\nHelper: Don't forget to breathe. Exams are stressful but I would suggest don't cram everything to the last minute. Usually the hour before the exam, I do something else.\nSeeker: Very good advice. Any suggestions on what I can do?\nHelper: Stay calm, believe in yourself, start your studying early so you are not cramming everything in the last few days.\nSeeker: Great Advice. But, in the one hour prior to the exam, do you have any advice on something I can do to calm my nerves?\nHelper: Walk outside, away from the students waiting for their tests.\nSeeker: Wonderful suggestion. Thank you for your help. I think I will go walk now.

I think its starting to become noticible\nHelper: That is a long time to think about something, so you have given it a lot of time and thought. Have you mentioned it to your partner?\nSeeker: i tried to do it around 8 months ago but my partner convinced herself that it was because i was cheating on her.

As far as I understand it's exceptionally easy to switch between therapists on that service, too. So if the first one is not a good fit, you can try someone else. The biggest piece of advice that I can give you is some that I've recently been enacting for myself: When you get into the spiral, and you can't shake the nasty repeated thoughts, even if you \"need\" to sleep, get out of bed and move to a different room. Change the situation up, get some tea, sparkling water, whatever you want, but change what your body is literally doing.\nSeeker: Oh yeah! That's true! I will try it. And also try to incorporate a better sleep schedule. And that is very helpful thank you. I do live in a small apartment, but I have noticed that when I get out of bed and at least move to the couch, it is a different environment even though it wouldn't seem like it. I never thought how that would help me though. I will totally do it more often when I am slumping\nHelper: You sound optimistic and open to trying new strategies to help yourself, I'm really impressed by your strength and resilience.

My fiance was cheating on me and everything has pretty much crumbled all around me.\nHelper: Oh my I'm so sorry that happened to you. I can't completely relate, but my parents are going through something very similar after 25 years of marriage. Tell me more about it.\nSeeker: I'm glad you haven't and so sorry to hear about them. We have been together for 13 years and have an 11 year old. He has been dating someone for nearly two years and i had no clue. I am so embarrassed and feel so stupid.\nHelper: I am so sorry. Does your child know? I have a 10 year old and she is struggling with my parents, we lived with them for the first 2 years of her life and have always been 15 minutes away since. I completely understand why you feel the way you do that is to be expected. You are not stupid and I'm sure its not you. Have you spoken to your fiance about this since you found out?\nSeeker: He is somewhat aware that something is going on but not quite sure what. One of us will be moving out so it will need to be explained to him soon. We have talked and he just denies everything. He told me I'm crazy and they are just \"friends. I would love to believe that but unfortunately I know that isn't true. I'm just overwhelmed with so may questions that he is not answering.\nHelper: I'm so sorry. From personal experience, my best advice is to be as direct as possible. Demand respect and answers that you deserve after 13 years. If he will not answer your questions, thats all the answers you need. How did you find out? I can't even imagine how you feel. Clarity and answers are so important right now for you... no matter if it is true or not. That is a long time to be with someone.\nSeeker: That is great advice! It's very hard to stand up for yourself sometimes especially when you are emotionally devastated. I visited him unannounced at work one day and they were having lunch together. I had no idea who she was and she got up and ran off. Upon further investigation, I checked phone records, receipts, any other thing I could find and all the evidence was there. two hour conversations, gifts from women's stores that weren't given to me.\nHelper: Oh my gosh. There's all the answers you need right there. I'm so sorry. He wont even speak to you about it? No excuses anything? Have you told family?\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [\"Empathy\"], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to empathize with the seeker's feelings and situation, but the helper is again too quick to draw conclusions.

Just do something you like to do to get your mind off of it\nSeeker: It helps to have a person to talk to. I used this chat Hit before right after I had to put her to sleep.

It makes me somewhat upset. I know they are most likely joking, but sometimes I take some of the things they say to me very personally. Should I still hang out with them even if they are making me feel this way?\nHelper: It sounds like your friends can be judgmental and even though they are joking it ends up upsetting you. I have been in a similar situation. I always expected my friends to support and understand me but sometimes they made fun of the way I am. Have you ever talked to your friends about this? Have you expressed how it made you feel?\nSeeker: Right. The people who you think you can go to are sometimes the ones who will not really be there for you. And I have not. I just try to brush it off. I feel like I am afraid to confront them about this because I don't know what they will say.\nHelper: From what I have seen if we avoid expressing our feelings they keep building up and can make us depressed.\nSeeker: That's true. Maybe I might give it a shot and talk to them about how I feel. It's just their response is what I'm afraid of because I don't know if they will react positively or negatively.\nHelper: I can tell that this bothers you a lot.\nSeeker: Kind of.

I cannot keep up with my classes and it is making me anxious\nHelper: Ok. That sounds like something that you should talk to someone about. How many classes are you taking at the moment?\nSeeker: I am taking 4 classes and I am struggling with all of them\nHelper: That's tough. A full load of courses. Do you have to take all of them right now? Can you adjust your course load?\nSeeker: I have to take them all right now to make sure that I graduate\nHelper: That's a challenging situation. Can you get help from the professor with the deadlines? Maybe you could look into getting a tutor.\nSeeker: My professors are trying to help they are actually being really nice. I am just having issues balancing it all honestly. I feel like I can never catch up on anything its just a lot on my plate. I think a tutor is actually a really good idea I might look into that\nHelper: Great! I think a tutor will give you some guidance on how to stay on top of your courses. Your situation is not unusual. Many students have difficulty trying to manage it all. Are you working a job as well?\nSeeker: I am just. I am also working right not. sorry my keyboard it messing up lol. I am working right now and its a part time job but it is still a lot for me. I think getting my time management under control is also so smart to make sure I can balance everything with less anxiety\nHelper: Ok. No worries! Can you adjust your hours at your job? Do you need the money, or can you maybe take a short break from work until you catch up?\nSeeker: So I do actually need the money. I just moved out on my own and I have a lot of bills that I use to not have when I was living with my parents. I might be able to cut back a couple hours a week but then I might have to give up some fun things I like to do\nHelper: True. Once you're on the other side of this semester, you can put in more hours. Do you absolutely have to finish this semester, or can you put off a course until the next term?\nSeeker: I would like to finish this semester just because I have a job lined up for me right when I graduate where I can make a lot more money and not struggle as much financially\nHelper: Is the job contingent on graduation? Maybe you could take one course while you do the job. Work full-time and study part-time.\nSeeker: I do have to have the degree to start the job thats the only part that isnt great. I would love to start at that company and go to school but they wont allow it.\nHelper: Do you have to get high grades in the courses, or just pass?\nSeeker: Luckily I just have to pass so it makes it a little less stressful. If I actually had to get a high grade oh man that would be the worst\nHelper: Ok. Do your best to pass. Try to cut back an hour or two at the job. Keep you eyes on the prize: the full-time job after graduation.\nSeeker: Yeah it all seems so far away but I just have to remind myself to look at the bright side and that something great is waiting for me at the end\nHelper: It sounds like you're really focused on your goal, which can seem far away at times. I'm here to support you throughout your journey.

Does he need help getting a refill? It can be hard to no our \"normal\" things when we don't feel; that's for sure.\nSeeker: i am not sure....but he has gone manic, super hyper, and says he doesn't need his mads any more, he just doesn't want them. so i can't help him get a refull no... i'm not sure how to help him, i've told him my concerns but he says he is just fine (he is not)\nHelper: If you are that worried about him, it does sound pretty severe, it may be time to call someone to get him help. Like his doctor or someone from the hospital.\nSeeker: i don't know who his doctor is...i tried talking to his sister, she said the hospital can't help him unless he goes there, and he does not want to\nHelper: We definitely don't want him to hurt himself or someone else. We definitely don't want him to hurt himself or someone else.\nSeeker: for sure. i'm not sure how to help someone who doesn't want help, you know? so basically i am just stuck with all this worry, i care about him\nHelper: Has his sister seen this kind of replace before? And if so how did they address it then? That is a really hard place to be. His doctors phone number is probably on his prescription bottle.\nSeeker: she told me she doesn't want anything to do with him, apparently he goes off his meds a lot, and it has been super hard on the family...they can't handle it. hey that's a good idea!. I'd have to be sneaky....go visit him and hunt around....but I could try that. its got me so worried it is affecting my sleep\nHelper: The doctor may not be able to get him in the office, but they would have his records and also be able to connect you to a facility to could maybe help him since the hospital can't\nSeeker: hmm okay, i can try that\nHelper: I can imagine, I'm worried now too and I don't even know your friend. I really hope you keep me updated on how things go.\nSeeker: i will try to! I think you're right though that the doctors office is the best place to call, thankyou for that suggestion. its tricky....with human rights they don't just haul people to hospital any more against their will lol\nHelper: You're so welcome. So it sounds like you'll call the doctor office (once you get the number) but please let me know if I can help any other way. lol, very true they do not. :)\nSeeker: hmm i can't think of anything....but it really helps to get this off my chest and to have a plan of action, thank you. its sad his family has given up on him. but i guess everyone has their limits\nHelper: You're very welcome. It's indeed a challenging situation. But remember, you're doing the best you can in this situation. It's important to take care of yourself and maintain boundaries so it doesn't affect you and your mental health. Your friend is fortunate to have someone who cares as much as you do.

I had to learn to not focus so much on BEING accepted. I had to learn what God think of me (he loves me) and try to be kind to all I meet, other centered. That is, I also had to make sure I wasn't being rude or mean. I can understand how hurtful that is. Our society isn't as kind as it once was. I find very few people appreciate kindness. However, I can't get caught up in that, it's the way people are. It isn't a reflection of myself.

Perhaps be kind without expecting anything in return, and know that God sees your kindness.\nSeeker: I always feel like you have to be a friend to have friends, but I\u2019m tired of being the only one putting effort in and getting taken advantage of\nHelper: It can be really frustrating to feel you're the only one putting in effort.

Is there something specific going on or is it just life in general?\nSeeker: My daughter struggles with school work and memory. She learns differently and needs lots of support. I have contacted the school a number of times over the years but never really had any support or acknowledgement from them. I guess it's just an accumulation of things.\nHelper: You have tried hard to help her and that is admirable. Don't beat yourself up and be proud of the things you have done for her.\nSeeker: But what do I now. She's 17 and it's so difficult to give her the time and then encourage her to tell me when she needs help and for her to be willing to accept it.\nHelper: While I do not have kids, from what I have seen my friends and family do in this situation is try to find something that your daughter is interested in and attempt to build off of that. So instead of her learning to just learn, she is learning something that is relevant to her. Maybe that might spark something in her to come up with her way of learning since traditional methods aren't working.\nSeeker: That is great advice. She does climb and hasn't been able to climb or see her friends with everything closed. I think as she will be able to again soon may be that will help her to relax and get back into it.

I'm feeling depressed and overwhelmed.\nHelper: Please tell me more about it, when did it start?\nSeeker: It all started earlier this year. I live with my parents because I'm unable to care for myself , due to a disability. Well my dad has dementia, and my mom, who was the primary caregiver, was diagnosed with cancer. She's been in and out of hospital so now its up to me to keep everything afloat.,. I'm having a really hard time with it.

My depression and anxiety are through the roof, and honestly, I'm not sure how long I can keep this up.\nHelper: Someone else would have collapsed already. Do you go outside a lot?\nSeeker: I actually am not able to go outside. Its been a few weeks.\nHelper: Maybe that's why your depression got worse. We need the sun and fresh air to feel better\nSeeker: i try to avoid going out at all. It's hard for me to get around. Even taking the bins out is a struggle. I can't even walk my dog. I just open the door and he goes out , does his business and comes back.\nHelper: I understand it's hard for a person like you. However, as I said, from my own experience, staying indoor for a long period does more harm than good. You don't have to go far, even just out in your backyard to have some sunlight as the first step is good enough\nSeeker: maybe i will try that. little by little. I'm really scared of the pandemic. I don't want to get sick.\nHelper: I hear your concerns about the pandemic, it's completely understandable.

How are you?\nSeeker: Well, my manager has decided that everyone in the office will continue to work from after the pandemic is under control. But I've found myself depressed from working from home all the time.\nHelper: Working from home is not what people expected. Many have found themselves isolated. They miss the interaction of the office. How long have you bee working from home?\nSeeker: For a full year--since March 2020, when the pandemic first started. I was working from home just 1 day per week prior to that, which I liked. But I've found that 5 days per week is much too much. I miss people. :(\nHelper: Have you and your co-workers talked to your boss about a hybrid schedule, maybe a couple days a week in the office? That might work.\nSeeker: That's where it gets awkward. It seems like everyone besides me are super happy that we'll continue working from home. I hesitate to share my feelings because maybe my manager will change her mind, which would be a big bummer for everyone else on the team (seemingly).\nHelper: I see. That's a concern. So you feel that if one person goes in to the office, then everyone else will have to? There won't be any flexibility?\nSeeker: Well, it's possible that my manager will say we can be flexible. But if so, I think I'd end up being the only one in my office working... which would be just as lonely as working from home while throwing away the few perks of working from home, like saving on gas. Plus, I think my company will probably want to repurpose our office space eventually. lol, sorry, that was an ugly run-on sentence. :\\\nHelper: Hm. A bit of a dilemma. Can this situation go on forever though? Maybe the boss will extend the stay-at-home for a while, but when other companies go back to the office, the expectation will be there for all companies. Other employees might change their minds bit by bit as well.\nSeeker: That is indeed a possibility. But my office is in a city that has a whole lot of high-tech companies, which were moving towards doing more work from home even BEFORE the pandemic. So it kind of feels like this might be a \"cultural shift\" in my area in general. Although there has GOT to be a whole lot of other people who feel like I do.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGive feedback to the Helper's last response.\n\n### Input:\nSeeker: I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot\nHelper: Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.\nSeeker: Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating.\nHelper: Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.\nSeeker: Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school.\nHelper: Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments.\nSeeker: Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break. I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe.\nHelper: Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing. HOw man classes do you have? many *\nSeeker: I have 6 classes\nHelper: That's a lot but it is totally doable. Here is a good example, If you plant seeds in a garden today, you have to weed it a bit tomorrow, the next day, the next day, you have to wait for rain, then weed some more, the harvest comes and YAY! You are happy. But if you lie on your bed, never planting, never weeding, you procrastinate, you get nothing. If you write your classes down and then write a reasonable time to study each one. Maybe 3 today, 3 tomorrow, then add rewards if you do that, maybe make a list of rewards, so you can pick and choose, then you check off when you do the subject. Like a chore chart.\nSeeker: Yes haha. That is a good comparison. You have been super helpful. I will for sure try to use your advice. Thank you!.

Maybe I should reach out on one of those platforms when I feel like I am going into one of my depressive episodes.\nHelper: It may be helpful! As far as I understand it's exceptionally easy to switch between therapists on that service, too. So if the first one is not a good fit, you can try someone else. The biggest piece of advice that I can give you is some that I've recently been enacting for myself: When you get into the spiral, and you can't shake the nasty repeated thoughts, even if you \"need\" to sleep, get out of bed and move to a different room.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGive feedback to the Helper's last response.\n\n### Input:\nSeeker: Thank you! That makes me feel better! But, I don't know how to make my neighbors feel that way and I hate being the outcast.\nHelper: I have neighbors who act in similar ways. They act as though they run the entire street, but they rent just like everyone else does here. Dealing with them can be very difficult at times.\nSeeker: Sounds like we live in the same neighborhood! Ha!\nHelper: Just based on what you're saying, I can completely understand why you feel the way that you do. In my opinion, you have every right to feel that way. Haha! It's not fun at all to have neighbors who make you feel as though you're somehow less than them. I know exactly what that feels like.\nSeeker: Yep! That's how I feel. What should I do to get back in good graces with them?\nHelper: I do know people who have gone through the exact same thing in the past. When another animal attacks one of your fur-babies, it's absolutely terrible. However, the fact that this woman was given the option to either get rid of her dog or move tells me that you are 100% correct in the way that you handled this situation. It's unfortunate for the woman, yes, but she should have had more control over her dog. It's bad enough when one animal is attacked, but when it's more than one, that's when you really know that it's a problem. Again, legally, she had to make a choice, and that's because she failed to properly secure her dog. I really don't feel as though you did anything wrong. If I were you, I would ask to speak with the neighbors who have an issue with you face-to-face. I know it may be difficult, but I think that would be the best way to go about it. Are you on good terms with the other person whose dog was attacked?\nSeeker: I totally agree with you! The woman is disabled and I think most of the neighbors feel sorry for her. I've seen her loose control of the dog before, but she never attacked another dog(s). I've even seem the dog pull her scooter over and the woman needed lots of help to get back into it. I think everyone feels sorry for her.\nHelper: That probably has a lot to do with it. I would feel sorry for her too, as it is very sad in general. However, it doesn't excuse the fact that her animal attacked two other dogs.\nSeeker: I've talked to the neighbors face-to-face and they just think that I overreacted. The woman started getting her dog and private training and so they feel that she was trying. My point was that my dog weighs 15 pounds and her dog weighs 45 pounds and, if it happens again, I may not have a dog anymore. I don't want to wait until a dog is killed or badly injured. I told them exactly what you just said, but they are being mean!. I guess I could try talking to them again. Maybe they've cooled off some.\nHelper: That is absolutely terrible. In that case, I would just tell them that you refuse to allow another dog to possible injure or kill your own dog, so you did what was necessary to protect your fur-baby. Had you not done anything, this could have happened again, and the outcome may have been much worse. At that point, if they still don't respond kindly, I'd tell them that you still feel as though you did what needed to be done, that you understand why they are upset, but that you will always do whatever it takes to protect your dog. Hopefully, they will stop being mean. Even if they just stop talking to you completely, it's better than them harassing you or something along those lines. If they do start escalating their nasty behavior, I'd let the manager of your complex know that you're being mistreated. I always try to keep things calm and quiet, but I refuse to be taken advantage of or treated poorly. Personally, as I stated previously, I wholeheartedly believe that you did the right thing. If they're unable to see that, I'd try to just avoid contact with them unless it's necessary. I know it stinks and I'd be sad too, but unfortunately, some people just don't know how to let things go and seem to find joy in making other people upset. I'm so sorrry that you're dealing with all of this.\nSeeker: Thank you so much! Those are really good suggestions. I'll do that and, hopefully, they will calm down. If not, I have other friends that live outside my neighborhood. And I can talk to the manager like you said. I appreciate your help today. And your validation that I did nothing wrong. I was beginning to second guess my actions.\nHelper: I'm so glad that I was able to offer helpful suggestions! Hang in there. You sound like a strong person! I would definitely spend some time with your true friends who live outside of your neighborhood. I can assure you that if someone else's animal attacked one of mine, I would have done the exact same thing that you did.\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Empathy\", \"Validation\", \"Suggestions\"]}",

I'm pretty good today, what about you?\nHelper: I'm doing really well, thanks. What brings you here today?\nSeeker: I'm just having some old thoughts about a past relationship. IT's making me sad\nHelper: I can appreciate that. Thinking about lost loves makes me sad too!. What about this particular relationship makes you feel sad?\nSeeker: Yeahhh I re read some old messages from a while back and just started thinking about it again. IT's going to sound quite dramatic, but I regret breaking up with this person. I feel as though they were my soulmate. And I ruined it\nHelper: Oh...I see, you think s/he's the \"one who got away?\". Why did you break up?\nSeeker: Pretty much... but the dumb thing about that is I am the one who broke it off. I was with him since beginning of high school, and so I never knew anything other than him. But Earlier this year I was having second thoughts and thought we should try new things for a while. In the beginning, I was doing fine and he was having a really hard time. But now I miss him more than anything and he is now better off without me\nHelper: Wow...that does sound painful. I know how hard it is to let go of a guy you really loved. I've had to break up with a few of them over the years!\nSeeker: Yeah? Do you miss any of them? Or do you feel like it was right for you in the long run\nHelper: In the long run, I feel that those break-ups were absolutely necessary. I'm in a really good place now. And they are too.\nSeeker: Yeah that is good. That is everything that I'm hoping for. But it's not coming fast enough\nHelper: I eventually learned to think of it like this: every man I loved taught me something important about myself. ANd I taught them things about themselves. ANd it doesn't happen overnight. But eventually, you will probably be able to see how you grew as a result of the breakup. Maybe the things you will learn can help you be ready for Mr Right!\nSeeker: I really appreciate that way of looking at it. Of course I will always cherish my memories and the things I learned from him. And I want to think of those things as happy experiences rather than sad memories\nHelper: That's a really good way of looking at it.\nSeeker: How long did it typically take you to finalyl be over them and happy with what you ecperienced?\nHelper: The process of healing from a breakup varies greatly from person to person. There's no set timeline for when you should be 'over' someone. It's okay to take the time you need to heal.\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Self-disclosure\"]}",

How are you?\nHelper: I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What are you seeking support for today?\nSeeker: I have been struggling for motivation to do anything the past couple weeks. This is a really hard time of year for me. I lost my cousin in a car accident at the age of 14 in a car accident coming up on 20 years this year. We were very close. I was 17 at the time. Her was an alcoholic and my parents raised her a majority of her life. Then 3 years ago 5 days after her death anniversary I lost my boyfriend at the age of 32 in a car accident. I dread the holidays.\nHelper: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you are describing a strong association between the holiday season and loss of loved ones. This leads to less of a desire to engage in typical holiday events. Does that sound right?\nSeeker: You are exactly right. The year my cousin got killed her mom was hungover so I went and picked up my cousin and her little brother to take them to our grandparents house for Christmas dinner. She died 4 days later on Dec 29th. And my boyfriend it was his first day back to work after the New Year. He died on Jan 3rd. I usually go all out for the holidays to try to hide my depression every year. This year I just can't bring myself to enjoy them. I have even bought one christmas present.\nHelper: I can see why this time of year is difficult for you. Trying to hide depression can be a challenge. Rather than hiding the sadness or grieving feelings, some people find relief in acknowledging and sharing these feelings with family members who may relate. Do you ever share these feelings with your cousin or grandparents that you mentioned?\nSeeker: My cousin doesn't live around here and we have never been real close. He is alot younger than me. We just never had the connection like his sister and I did. And both my grandparents have passed away. Grandpa has been gone for 12 years and Grandma has been gone for 4 now. My family has always been really good about talking about our loses. Things just will never be the same.\nHelper: It sounds like the season used to carry a lot of joy for you, and now it's associated with painful memories. This must be incredibly hard for you.

Now, I need to get a job, but I'm having difficulty finding jobs for my degrees. And it's just stressful and depressig\nHelper: Drastic changes in our life plans can feel very upsetting and looking for a job in these times is ridiculous.\nSeeker: Yes, it really is\nHelper: What made you feel the need to drop out of graduate school?\nSeeker: I wasn't finding the program challenging or interesting or a life course I was sure I wanted to go down anymore. The only jobs I really can do with biology are lab jobs, which are somewhat boring. There are some others, but not many\nHelper: I understand that and that was a really brave choice to make before you cornered yourself into a degree that wouldn't benefit your future paths.\nSeeker: Yea, I think that's true. Other people say that I am a quitter. They say I quit everything\nHelper: Have you gone and smoke to your local job centers? They can often times find suitable jobs or even creative suggestions that can utilize your skills and even grown them.\nSeeker: No, I'm not aware of any local job centers around me. I mostly have been looking online at places like indeed.com. I'm not sure what you mean by \"job center,\" I guess, either\nHelper: Refusing to finish something that does not benefit your end goal isn't quitting its merely switching strategies to your personal end goal\nSeeker: Oh, yea. That's a good reframe. I like that. I suppose, I'm just getting older and wish I had better, more stable options available to me. All this education hasn't really left with me many hard skills, I feel\nHelper: I am from North Carolina and in every city there are job centers, you can look them up by that title, they have people there who can help you find work based on your personality and skills. as well helping with resumes, interveiws, computers, all kinds of things.\nSeeker: Interesting. I guess I can look into that. I am from Ohio. That's not bad advice. I am somewhat kicking myself for paying so much money on education that wasn't really worth that much. I guess there isn't much I can do about that, though\nHelper: Im sorry you feel that way but education is never a wasted effort it can only make you level up even if you choose not to actively use what you acquire. Its always nice to have a big back up arsenal so you have options when something you want does turn up. Im really glad that suggestion might be helpful for you. Have you checked to see if any of the credits you have earned already are transferable to another degree you may find of interest?\nSeeker: I suppose there can be truth in that. I had a friend say that as well, that education is never a wasted effort. I agree sometimes. I should have thought about the program more before I went into it, but ah, oh well. Nothing I can do about it, now. No, it wouldn't be transferable. I have though about doing some grad school for something bio related. I don't know. I'm 30 now and getting burned out, to be honest. Anyway, you've said a lot of nice and helpful things. I don't want to take too much time from you. After all, you won your bonus money. But, I really do appreciate you talking to me.\nHelper: oh man that sucks, I am sorry.
